        <p>My web-development story began not so long ago but I have improved leaps and bounds in the short time. Both backend and frontend are areas where I feel comfortable. And these showcase projects should reflect that.</p>

            <h1>Happy dev website</h1>
            <p>This POC website is a longer term project. 
                It is a concept of a tool to help developers write, maintain and comment on code documentation.
                Every developer knows that this is one of the most labourius tasks to do.
                So this project showcases my induvidual skill of Front end Angular 17 skills. But also being able to brainstorm ideas and designs.

            <h1>Happy dev REST backend</h1>
            <p>
                The Happy-dev REST backend server is made with C# ASP.NET CORE 8.0
                I did this to specifically show that I am comfortable quickly switching to a different language.
                The project also uses a SQL database to store its users data. The project includes things like authentication, authorization and microservice concepts.

                I think after looking at my website you realised I pulled out all the stops to make this website as attractive as possible.
                A lot of advanced CSS concepts are shown here. All to prove 1 thing. 
                I can learn and I learn fast.
                This website was made with only 3 weeks of CSS knowledge under my belt.
                So I hope that it this proved that correct and that it impressed some people.
